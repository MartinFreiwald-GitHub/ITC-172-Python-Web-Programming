# This is the review of what was acomplished here,

# set up the project 
# adjusted the settings
# within setting, we coded this, 
# 1.  created directory, tech and added to installed apps
# 2.  changed the database to postgres
# 3. downloaded psycopg2
# 4.  in the project urls added include and redirected to the app level url.
# 5.  in the app level urls we inported views and added a view called index.  
# 6.  Within views created that index.
# 7.  Index.py added a request to tech/index.html.
# 8.  Inside tech directory add folder called templates and inside this we added file called base.html.  This will be the basis for all the web pages here.  Uses bootstrap and it has block content.
# 9.  In the index.html it does extends base.html it has a content area we did a little sql html inside of that and allows us to run the server and see the web page. 
# 10.  Then closed out the server with a ctrl-c command.  That being the web # page. 
# 11.  Finally, applied the migration to the directory techreview2 in the # visual studio code terminal.
