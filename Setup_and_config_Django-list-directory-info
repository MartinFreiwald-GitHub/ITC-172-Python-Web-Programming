# Setup and Configure Django --steps

# The first two assignments involved a lot of steps, so I though it might be useful to list them. Most of these steps only need to be done once. Also I want to reiterate that the tech review project and app are the in-class examples, the assignments are all with the python club project and app.

# Initial set up
# Create a directory for the django projects
# Install django into that directory
# Install venv, the virtual environment
# Activate the virtual environment
# Create the project techreviews
# change directory into techreviews and start the app tech
# (do the same two steps with pythonclub)
# Configuration
# Create the techreviewdb in pgadmin (also create pythonclubdb)
# Open VSCode, Open a folder to the outermost techteview folder
# Also open a terminal in VSCode
# Open the settings.py file in the project folder.
# In the settings.py file add 'tech' to the registered apps list.
# Also in the settings.py change the database to postgresql_psycopg2.
# You will need to install psycopg2 using pip, using the terminal in VSCode
# Migrate the databases
# In the project lever urls.py add an include that points to the app's url
# Add a urls.py file to the app directory
# At this point you will have completed the setup and configuration
